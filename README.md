# abn-tv-shows

## Project Description

abn-tv-shows is a single-page application that lets users browse and explore TV shows sourced from the [TVMaze public API](https://api.tvmaze.com). Users can browse a paginated catalogue of shows, filter by genre, and open a dedicated details page for each show with information such as rating, schedule, genres, language, premiere date, and a summary. The details page also includes an Episodes tab with a responsive episodes list (episode number, season, name, rating, airdate, airtime, and image) plus client-side search/filter support.

**Data flow:** Views consume Pinia stores → stores call `fetchClient` → `fetchClient` wraps the native `fetch` API against the TVMaze REST API.

**Pagination strategy:** All shows are fetched in a single request on startup and stored in `allShows`. Client-side computed properties handle genre filtering (`filteredShows`) and page slicing (`pagedShows`), so navigating between pages and switching genres never triggers an additional network request.

## Main Flows

### 1. Browse the shows catalogue

1. User navigates to `/` → `ShowsDashboardView` mounts.
2. `useShowsStore` initialises with a `watch({ immediate: true })` on the pagination state, which triggers `fetchShows()` on startup.
3. `fetchShows()` calls `GET /shows` on the TVMaze API and stores the full response in `allShows`.
4. The computed chain derives the visible data:
   - `filteredShows` — `allShows` filtered by the selected genre (or the full list when _All_ is selected).
   - `pagedShows` — a slice of `filteredShows` for the current page and page size.
   - `showsByGenre` — `pagedShows` grouped and sorted by genre, consumed by the dashboard template.
5. `ShowsTile` components render for each show in the current page's genre groups.

### 2. Filter shows by genre

1. User opens the genre menu via the `GenreSelector` button and picks a genre.
2. `setSelectedGenre` in `useGenreStore` updates `selectedGenre`.
3. A `watch` in `useShowsStore` detects the genre change and calls `resetPagination()` (page resets to 0, total record count is updated to match the newly filtered result set).
4. `filteredShows` and all downstream computeds (`pagedShows`, `showsByGenre`) recompute automatically — no additional network request is made.
5. The active genre is shown as a dismissible chip inside `GenreSelector`; clicking the × icon resets the filter back to _All shows_.

### 3. Navigate between pages

1. User clicks a page number, next, or previous in the `ShowsPagination` (PrimeVue `Paginator`) component.
2. The `@page` event fires and calls `usePaginationStore.setPage(newPage)`.
3. The `watch` in `useShowsStore` detects the page change and recomputes `pagedShows` from the already-loaded `filteredShows` slice — no network request is made.
4. `showsByGenre` updates and the dashboard re-renders the new page of shows.
5. When a genre filter is applied or cleared, pagination automatically resets to page 0 so the user always starts from the first page of the new result set.

### 4. View show details

1. User clicks a `ShowsTile` → `router.push('/show/:id')`.
2. `ShowsDetailsView` mounts with the route param `id` as a prop.
3. `onMounted` triggers `useShowDetailsStore.fetchShowDetails(id)`, which calls `GET /shows/:id`.
4. While loading, `ShowDetailsSkeleton` is displayed. When the response arrives, `ShowDetailsMain` renders the full information (image, rating, genres, information, summary, official site).
5. `ShowTabs` provides tabbed navigation (Main / Episodes / Photos) within the detail page.

### 5. View and filter episodes list

1. On the show details page, user opens the _Episodes_ tab.
2. `ShowEpisodeList` consumes `useShowEpisodesStore` and calls `fetchShowEpisodes(showId)`, which requests `GET /shows/:id/episodes`.
3. While episodes are being fetched, the DataTable loading state is shown.
4. When data arrives, episodes are rendered in a paginated, responsive PrimeVue DataTable.
5. Users can filter episodes using the search input (global filter) by number, season, or name.
